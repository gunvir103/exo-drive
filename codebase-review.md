# Exo Drive Codebase and Database Review

This document outlines potential issues and improvements for the Exo Drive application before pushing to production.

## Database Structure Issues

### 1. Bucket Mismatch
- **Issue**: The SQL migration creates a bucket named `cars` but the application code uses `vehicle-images` in `BUCKET_NAMES.VEHICLE_IMAGES`.
- **Impact**: Image upload and retrieval operations may fail.
- **Fix**: Either update the migration to create a `vehicle-images` bucket or update the code constants.

### 2. Storage Paths in Database
- **Issue**: Car image URLs are stored in the database but not their storage paths, making image deletion unreliable.
- **Impact**: When deleting images, the code has to guess the storage path from the URL, which is fragile.
- **Fix**: Store both the URL and storage path in the `car_images` table.

### 3. Schema Validation
- **Issue**: No schema validation for incoming data in the API endpoints.
- **Impact**: Incorrect or malformed data could enter the database.
- **Fix**: Add validation (e.g., with Zod) for API endpoints.

## API Issues

### 1. Cookie Handling TypeScript Error
- **Issue**: TypeScript error in `app/api/cars/upload/route.ts` related to cookie handling.
- **Impact**: Could cause build errors or runtime issues.
- **Fix**: Update cookie handling to use the correct type approach.

```typescript
get(name: string) {
  const cookie = cookieStore.get(name);
  return cookie?.value;
}
```

### 2. Error Handling in Upload API
- **Issue**: Error handling doesn't consistently return detailed information.
- **Impact**: Debugging upload issues in production could be difficult.
- **Fix**: Standardize error responses and add more detailed logging.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- **Issue**: Authentication is implemented but role-based authorization is commented out.
- **Impact**: Anyone with a Supabase account could potentially access admin features.
- **Fix**: Implement and uncomment the profile role check in API endpoints.

## Frontend Issues

### 1. Type Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: Some places might still reference deprecated types or fields (e.g., `price` vs `pricePerDay`).
- **Impact**: Runtime errors when accessing non-existent properties.
- **Fix**: Audit all files for proper type usage.

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness
- **Issue**: Admin image upload interface might not be fully optimized for mobile use.
- **Impact**: Difficulty uploading images from mobile devices.
- **Fix**: Improve mobile UI for admin upload features, add mobile-specific optimizations.

### 3. Loading States
- **Issue**: Some components may not handle loading states correctly.
- **Impact**: Poor user experience during data fetching.
- **Fix**: Ensure all data-fetching components have proper loading states.

## Performance Issues

### 1. Image Optimization
- **Issue**: No client-side image optimization before upload.
- **Impact**: Large image uploads can be slow, especially on mobile.
- **Fix**: Add client-side image compression and resizing before upload.

### 2. Caching Strategy
- **Issue**: No clear caching strategy for loaded data.
- **Impact**: Unnecessary data fetching, slower perceived performance.
- **Fix**: Implement SWR or React Query for data fetching with caching.

## Security Issues

### 1. Exposed Service Role Key
- **Issue**: Service role key is used in API routes but environment variable handling needs audit.
- **Impact**: Potential exposure of sensitive keys.
- **Fix**: Ensure service role key is never exposed to the client.

### 2. Bucket Permissions
- **Issue**: Storage bucket permissions may be too permissive.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to uploaded files.
- **Fix**: Audit and tighten storage bucket policies in Supabase.

### 3. SQL Injection Protection
- **Issue**: Direct SQL queries without parameterization.
- **Impact**: SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Fix**: Ensure all SQL queries are properly parameterized.

## Infrastructure Issues

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Issue**: No documented process for setting up the development environment.
- **Impact**: Difficulty onboarding new developers.
- **Fix**: Create a comprehensive setup guide.

### 2. Missing Error Monitoring
- **Issue**: No error monitoring solution integrated (e.g., Sentry).
- **Impact**: Production errors may go unnoticed.
- **Fix**: Integrate an error monitoring solution.

## Deployment Issues

### 1. Deployment Pipeline
- **Issue**: No documented CI/CD pipeline.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent and potentially error-prone deployments.
- **Fix**: Set up and document a CI/CD pipeline.

### 2. Database Migrations
- **Issue**: No clear process for applying migrations in production.
- **Impact**: Database schema changes could be risky.
- **Fix**: Document the migration process for production.

## Testing Issues

### 1. Missing Tests
- **Issue**: Limited or no automated tests visible in the codebase.
- **Impact**: Regressions and bugs are more likely to occur.
- **Fix**: Add unit, integration, and E2E tests.

### 2. Missing Monitoring
- **Issue**: No usage monitoring or analytics.
- **Impact**: Limited visibility into application usage and performance.
- **Fix**: Integrate analytics and monitoring solutions.

## Recommendations for Local Testing

1. Verify Supabase buckets exist and match code references
2. Test authentication flow and admin access
3. Test image upload and deletion
4. Verify mobile responsiveness of admin features
5. Check error handling across all features
6. Ensure proper loading states for all data fetches
